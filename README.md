# DATA100 A3 Part3

!!! Just Draft !!!

**Initial Assumption**

- We assume that during the pandemic, since there's sudden drastic decrease of human activities across the year due to quarantine, it might affect climate change so that the impact of climate change during that year should be less.

- Since climate change related to global temperature change, we assume that this change might affect both ice extent (how much ice of iceberg dissolved) and the hurricanes. (hypothesis)

- Fact 1: The higher the global temperature change, the higher the ice extent. (Temperature will change the condition of ice extent)

- Fact 2: The higher the global temperature change, the higher the hurricane speed. (Temperature will change the condition for hurricane)

**Research direction**

- We realize there's no drastic change or relationship between drastic less human activities during COVID-19 and climate change reduction based on the research online.

**Analysis for plot 3**

- We learn that there's no significant relationship between covid2020 and ice_extent_daily.

- We can try to talk about why the relationship is invalid between covid2020 and ice_extent_daily.
